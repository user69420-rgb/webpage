        <p class="text">A 6G network is defined as a cellular network that operates in untapped radio frequencies and uses cognitive technologies like AI to enable high-speed, 
            low-latency communication at a pace multiple times faster than fifth-generation networks. 6G networks are currently under research and development</p>
        <h2 class="text">Wi-Fi 7</h2>
        <p class="text">WiFi 7 (IEEE 802.11be) is the seventh generation of the 802.11 standard since 1997. It packs all the benefits of WiFi 6/6E and expands several 
            existing standards to a whole new level, such as 320 MHz bandwidth and 4K-QAM. And it introduces some revolutionary features like Multi-Link Operation, 
            Multi-Resource Units (MRU) and Puncturing. As WiFi has become indispensable in daily life from work to home, WiFi 7 reshapes your WiFi experiences with 
            a huge leap into the future</p>

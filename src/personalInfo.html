            I am a Computer Engineering Studen, at the Engineering School, UNAM.
            I like everything that has to do with IT, specially software, from the most basic tasks such as creating a calculator to building a docker container running a database to collect information of a sensor connected to an SP-32 microcontroller
            My hobbies are:
            <ul class="text">
                <li><h3>Playing games on my PC </h3><br>
                    It's a hobbie I picked up since I was 10 years old, it has brought me lots of fun and it has changed my life several times.

                <li><h3>Listening to music</h3> <br>
                    I really love music, brings joy to even the most dire situations<br>
